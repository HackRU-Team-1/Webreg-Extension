	*by Corentin Rejaud, Daniel Tsioni, and Gavriel Tsioni*

# About
	
This extension allows Rutgers University students to easily access information on RateMyProfessors.com directly from certain Rutgers University websites.

Development for this project began on Saturday, 4/18/15, at the Rutgers University hackathon HackRU. It was placed in the top five hacks and won the subcategory "Best Rutgers Hack".

As of now, the extension works on	

	1. WebReg	
	2. Schedule of Classes
	3. Course Schedule Planner
	
# What does it do?

This extension places a button next to each instructors name which allows a student to easily search for that instructors name on RateMyProfessors.com, a website which compiles student reviews about their instructors. Many students utilize this website in their decision-making process when choosing classes, and this extension streamlines that process significantly.

# How do I use it?

To search for a professor, simply click the "Search" button next to their name. A new tab will open up which will display the search results for that professors last name, filtered by Rutgers University on RateMyProfessors.com.
